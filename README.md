# Three.js Animated Line Tree Example

This repository contains a minimal example that draws a simple tree using line segments in [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). The tree is animated so that each point appears every 0.5 seconds.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start a local server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Then open the provided URL in your web browser.

The tree will gradually draw itself and resize with the browser window.
