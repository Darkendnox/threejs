# Three.js Rotating Cube Example

This repository contains a minimal example of a rotating cube using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).

## Usage

1. Install dependencies (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. If you are running from a local server, you can use `npx http-server` or any other static server.

The cube will rotate continuously and resize with the browser window.
